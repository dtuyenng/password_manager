TODO:
    - change name of the app using pyinstaller --windowed --name="My Password Manager" main.py
    - implement "notes" field
    - implement double-click to "show more" to view notes, add a "have notes" icon to row
    - implement edit for "notes"
    - the encryption password and salt are hard-coded. Take them out

Optimization:
    - code is getting a little bit messy. Refactor to classes
    - load_key on startup could use some refinements, could for example rename it so it isn't implied to be
    only used during startup
    - import/export reusing multiple code fragments, need to clean that up


Bugs:
    - pyinstaller using --onefile not working, keys arent saved. Something with the paths (solved use
       --add-data pyinstaller  --windowed --add-data 'data.bin:.'  main.py and spec file)
    --windowed works though. Some reasons, in mac, pyinstaller STILL create a single file executable s
    that's ok...
